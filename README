The idea:

Use Three.js[1] and parse_pto.py[2] to render panorama projects from hugin[3] in 3D from the original source images.

How?  Dunno yet, maybe a py module to convert pto to json for consumption on the client.  Have used Three yet, so not sure what exactly it can do (textures, warp surfaces, ...).  Maybe some kind of texture scaling/tiling involved?
